# Machine Learning & Neural Networks from Scratch (JavaScript)

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning and Neural Networks work internally**, implemented **from scratch using JavaScript**, without relying on external ML libraries or frameworks.

The goal of this project is to understand the **core logic behind neural networks** such as forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.

---

## Project Overview

- Neural Network implemented using **pure JavaScript**
- No ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch
- Focuses on learning **fundamental concepts**, not black-box usage
- Suitable for beginners who want to understand ML internals

---

## Features

- Manual implementation of:
  - Neurons and layers
  - Forward propagation
  - Error calculation (loss)
  - Weight and bias updates
- Trains on sample input data
- Console-based output for learning clarity

---

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- Runs in browser console or Node.js
- No external machine learning libraries used
